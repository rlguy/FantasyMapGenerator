Introduction of Argtable3
=========================

Argtable is an open source ANSI C library that parses GNU-style command-line
options. It simplifies command-line parsing by defining a declarative-style API
that you can use to specify what your command-line syntax looks like. Argtable
will automatically generate consistent error handling logic and textual
descriptions of the command line syntax, which are essential but tedious to
implement for a robust CLI program.


Quick Start of Argtable3
========================

Argtable3 is a single-file ANSI-C library. All you have to do is adding
argtable3.c to your projects, and including argtable3.h in your source code.


Documentation and Examples
==========================

To learn how to use the Argtable3 API, you can see the documentation on the web
site, or examples in the examples folder.

To build the examples, open the console window of your favorite development
environments, go to the examples folder, and use the included Makefiles to build
the examples.

If you use GCC (Linux, MinGW, Cygwin), type:

  $ make

If you use Microsoft Visual C++ compiler, type:

  $ nmake /f Makefile.nmake

To cleanup, type "make cleanall" or "nmake /f Makefile.nmake cleanall".


Unit Tests
==========

Argtable3 is a BSD-licensed open source library, so you can modify the library
anyway you want. However, before committing your code to your own repository or
the Argtable3 official repository, please make sure your changes can pass the
unit tests included in the distribution.

To build and run the unit tests, open the console window of your favorite
development environments, go to the tests folder, and use the included Makefiles
to build and run the unit tests.

If you use GCC (Linux, MinGW, Cygwin), type:

  $ make

If you use Microsoft Visual C++ compiler, type:

  $ nmake /f Makefile.nmake

To cleanup, type "make cleanall" or "nmake /f Makefile.nmake cleanall".
